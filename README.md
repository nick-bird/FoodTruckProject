# Food Truck Project

## Project Description
This project models a Food Truck with a unique number ID, name, food type, and rating, which are all entered by a user. The program then prints a menu, which allows the user to print a list of all the trucks they entered, see the highest rated truck only, or see the average rating between all trucks entered.

## Topics and Technologies Used
This project uses a class with encapsulated fields to abstract a Food Truck, and interacts with an application that allows a user to modify and use up to 5 food trucks with unique field values.

## Lessons Learned
In order to allow the user to create multiple instances of a Food Truck and assign each one a new number ID, I had to use a static variable, which I was able to increment each time my Food Truck constructor is called.
